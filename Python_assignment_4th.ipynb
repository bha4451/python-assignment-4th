        "\n",
        "● A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
        "● Think of a class like a design plan for a house. You can build many houses from the same\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintainability:\n",
        "\n",
        "● Since polymorphism enables different classes to have methods with the same name, you\n",
        "only need to update a method in one place (the class). If you want to change how a specific\n",
        "type behaves, you can simply override the method in that class.\n",

        "Simplified Code:\n",

        "● It makes the code cleaner and more readable. You don’t have to deal with different function\n",
        "names for each class—just use the same method name, and the right version gets executed\n",
        "based on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supports Dynamic Behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "● With polymorphism, Python can determine at runtime which method to call, based on the\n",
        "object type. This leads to more flexible and dynamic behavior.\n",
        "Promotes Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "● Polymorphism is great for extending functionality. As you add new classes, you don’t need to\n",

        "● Abstract methods (sound and move) must be overridden in the subclasses (Dog and Bird).\n",

        "**16. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "● 🏆 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brings several key advantages that make software\n",
        "development more efficient, flexible, and manageable. By organizing code into classes and\n",
        "objects, OOP improves reusability, maintainability, and scalability of applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 1. Modularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "● OOP breaks down a program into smaller, manageable parts (objects and classes).\n",
        "\n",
        "● Each class is like a module, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and test.\n",
        "\n",
        "● This promotes separation of concerns (i.e., each class handles its own specific functionality).\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 2. Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "● Through inheritance, you can reuse existing code (methods and properties) without having to\n",
        "rewrite it.\n",
        "\n",
        "● Once a class is written and tested, it can be reused in different programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "● This leads to less code duplication and saves time in future development.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 3. Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "● Polymorphism allows you to use the same method name for different object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "OOPS ASSIGNMENT\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "● You can extend existing classes (using inheritance) without altering the original code, making\n",
        "it easy to introduce new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "● This leads to flexible systems that can adapt to new requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 4. Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "● Encapsulation keeps the internal state of an object hidden and only exposes a public\n",
        "interface (via methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "● This helps to protect data and ensures that an object’s internal state is not changed\n",
        "unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "● It also makes it easier to debug since you can isolate issues within individual objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 5. Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "● Abstraction hides complex details and shows only the necessary information.\n",
        "\n",
        "● It allows programmers to interact with objects through simplified interfaces while hiding the\n",
        "implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "● This leads to cleaner, more understandable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 6. Easier Maintenance and Modification:\n",
        "\n",
        "● Since OOP encourages the use of modular code, it becomes easier to update and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "● Changes in one class usually don’t affect others, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "● It’s easy to add or modify features without affecting the whole system, making maintenance\n",
        "more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 7. Improved Productivity:\n",
        "\n",
        "● OOP’s organization of code into classes and objects leads to better collaboration among\n",
        "teams of developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "● Code can be maintained and extended by different teams working on different modules\n",
        "independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "● Code libraries and frameworks often use OOP, giving developers access to tools that make\n",
        "development faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 8. Increased Security:\n",
        "\n",
        "● OOP allows you to control access to data through getter and setter methods, which helps in\n",
        "protecting data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "● Access modifiers (e.g., private, protected, public) help in restricting access to an object’s\n",
